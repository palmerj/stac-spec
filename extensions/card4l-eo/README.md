# STAC CARD4L Optical Extension

- **Title: CARD4L Optical**
- **Identifier: card4l-eo**
- **Field Name Prefix: card4l** (shared with the CARD4L SAR Extension)
- **Scope: Item**
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](../README.md#extension-maturity): Proposal**

This extension specifies how to create STAC Items that comply to the [CEOS CARD4L](http://ceos.org/ard/) product family specification for either
- *Optical Surface Reflectance* (SR) products in version 5.0
  ([PDF](http://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/SR/v5.0/CARD4L_Product_Family_Specification_Surface_Reflectance-v5.0.pdf),
  [Word](http://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/SR/v5.0/CARD4L_Product_Family_Specification_Surface_Reflectance-v5.0.docx))
  *or*
- *Optical Surface Temperature* (ST) products in version 5.0
  ([PDF](http://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/ST/v5.0/CARD4L_Product_Family_Specification_Surface_Temperature-v5.0.pdf),
  [Word](http://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/ST/v5.0/CARD4L_Product_Family_Specification_Surface_Temperature-v5.0.docx)).

**Document structure:** In general, the fields required in this extension are required to either meet the *threshold (minimum) requirements* by the CEOS CARD4L specification *or* are required fields in STAC. Any additional optional field provided may lead to a higher percentage of the CARD4L *target (desired) requirements* met.

The column *Field Name* refers to the STAC field names. The column *Req.* refers to the requirement number in the CARD4L specification.

**STAC Extensions:** This extension makes use of a number of existing STAC extensions:

- [EO](../eo/README.md)
- [File](../file/README.md)
- [Processing](../processing/README.md) (optional)
- [Projection](../projection/README.md)
- [View](../view/README.md)

You have to read the STAC extensions in combination with this extension as this extension just provides the mapping between the STAC fields and the CARD4L requirements, but this extension doesn't give information on the data type or an actual detailed description about the fields.

**Additional resources:**

- [Examples](examples/) (ToDo)
- [JSON Schema](json-schema/) (ToDo)

## STAC Collections

CARD4L lists a lot of requirements (and fields) that have common values across all generated STAC Items and assets.
Thus, it is **recommended** to provide a STAC Collection for the Items and put common fields (in the STAC Item `properties`)
into [Collection `summaries`](../../collection-spec/collection-spec.md#collection-fields).
While the STAC Item fields still need to be in the Item, too, you can de-duplicate links and assets by putting common
links once into the STAC Collection links. Also, common assets can be just put once into the STAC Collection using the
STAC extension [Collection Assets](../collection-assets/README.md).
All this is still CARD4L compliant as CARD4L doesn't require all information to be in a single file.

## STAC Items

STAC Items must always be valid, but not all STAC Item requirements are covered here, only additional requirements and mappings to fulfill the CARD4L requirements are listed here:

### STAC Item Assets

Whether the metadata are provided in a single record relevant to all pixels, or separately for each pixel, is at the discretion of the data provider. 

Each of the assets can either be exposed individually or grouped together in any form. In the latter case the role names can simply be merged to a set of unique role names. Roles can also be combined for a single file. For example, a cloud mask which is also including cloud shadows can use the roles `cloud` and `cloud-shadow` for a single file. The `file:values` property can the contain which value(s) correspond to clouds and which value(s) correspond to cloud shadows respectively.

The *italic* role names are proposed to be the asset's key. The **bold** additional properties are required.

## Notes

1.13: The algorithms can be given either in `proc:software` or as link with relation type `about`. One of them is **required** by CARD4L.

1.15: STAC only mandates to use `processing:lineage` to describe processing chains, but you may also include or link to a more machine-readable processing chain description such as a Dask graph, an openEO process or a SNAP graph.

1.17: Other data quality flags than `eo:cloud_cover` should be set.

2.13 (SR): CARD4L lists no specific requirements thus it's missing in this document, too.

3.2 (SR) / 3.3 (ST): Measurement Uncertainty is not required and it was not clear in which form this should be provided. Also the CARD4L specification states for SR that "\[i]n current practice, users determine fitness for purpose based on knowledge of the lineage of the data, rather than on a specific estimate of measurement uncertainty." Thus this requirement is not captured in this document.

3.3 (SR): Measurement Normalisation is not required and it was not clear in which form this should be provided. Thus this requirement is not captured in this document, but we have added a link relation type to link to information on measurement normalisation.

4.1 (SR): This requirement doesn't list any direct requirements for the metadata.
